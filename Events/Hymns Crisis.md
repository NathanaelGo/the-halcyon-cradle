An ongoing event. After the [[Equinox Banquet]] and [[Equinox (The Party)|The Party]] leaving [[Concord]], massive [[Hekate's Hymns|Hymns]] have appeared all throughout [[Ilios]], destroying several cities and plunging the world into further chaos. Refugee waves have been hitting a lot of towns and there is a lot of unrest. 

## Erymnos Disorders
The situation in [[Erymnos]] was critical, and [[Moros]] has withheld support due to the schemes of [[Barry Jenkins]]. [[Ashley Anne Helsing|Ashley]] was being used as a scapegoat by the corrupt ex-governor of the Marsind Band (a portual district of Erymnos).

Equinox brought additional supplies and funds, and eventually exposed the governor as a plant of the [[Grimarchs]] that were looking for something in the city.
