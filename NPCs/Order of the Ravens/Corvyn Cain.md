### Summary
Ravane's master

[[Corvyn Cain]] is a broken chain and knows little and cant pass much on

Can pluck off feathers and do a psudo sending - Not his actual voice 

Ran into Ravane in Belialâ€™s Directory [[Codex]]
Was searching to see if some people who are dead were actually possessed 
Crypt is safe but not sure if the sexton is safe

Pointed to a book with the title [[Lilith Altair]] - opens to a random page
'Im searching for something - Its quite a conundrum you were too'
