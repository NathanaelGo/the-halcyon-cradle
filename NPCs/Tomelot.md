### Summary
Powerful wizard residing in [Concord]. Was originally part of {insert party name here} before learning too much about the world and being forced to don cursed armor turning him mad.

[[Equinox (The Party)]] befriended him and briefly became their pupils while visiting [[Sadura]] and up until the [[Warden Trials]].

During the [[Equinox Banquet]], [[Aurora]] with the help of the [[Grimoire Monarch]] and a gang of 6 sins (sins wrath) tried to execute him.

His original survival hinged on the fact he wore the cursed armor and would never take up another pupil.

Now with the cursed armor removed he's become a new person. He temporarily forgot his past.
