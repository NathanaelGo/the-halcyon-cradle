Bridge of [[Orion]]

### Current Location
[[Moros]]

___
### Summary
Running for Mayor in [[Moros]], plans on passing off the keys of the kingdom to a good knight.
Runs the pseudo-space in Moros (access by closing eyes on center bridge)

Cursed: His gut is always wrong. He has to do the opposite of what he believes he should do.

Wants us to:
- Provide him dirt on the Union from PoV Dominion
	- Diplomats on Codex, Union Diplomats and their experiences, send those through Equinox channels
- Bring down [[Alexander Franklin Roberts]]
- Push for allegiances, talks, diplomacy. We have reason to believe the Empire will get too much from the Dominion in the coming weeks and months.
