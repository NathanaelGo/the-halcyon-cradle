Rex Apexes that have been defending Zweiza from outside influences and keeping the Borderlands region independent.

After the [[Codexica Dominion]] attacked the Borderlands, they repelled the invasion and founded [[Concord]]

[[Deus Gremory]] gave them head pats after they helped prevent [[Tomelot]]'s death during the [[Equinox Banquet]]

Being far away from the city causes them to lose their individuality. Possibly caused by their specific [[Authority]].
