Two [[Rex Apex]]es

[[Deus Gremory]] gave them head pats after they helped prevent [[Tomelot]]s death during the [[Equinox Banquet]]

Stationed in [[Zweiza]]

Being far away from the city causes them to lose their individuality? iirc
This 100% has to be something like the funny uncertainty sword. putting a pin in this thought for later
