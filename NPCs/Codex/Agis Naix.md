#### Gala Hall
The highest end pleasure hall in Codex, and debatably the greatest publicly available center of hedonism on Ilios. It has everything from casinos to prostitutes to drugs to entertainment. The gigantic establishment has sections that are family-friendly, dens that would traumatize most, and everything in between. Ran by Kingpin Agis Naix of House Ilios.
