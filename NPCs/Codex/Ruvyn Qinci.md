##### Outlander Vicinage
The designated “foreigner” zone of Codex. Most of its population are still elves, but most of the residentials, businesses, and establishments are owned by and cater to non-Codex natives. Its Steward rules the region with an iron fist, ensuring no rambunctious antics seep out of Outlander Vicinage and into the wider whole of Codex.
