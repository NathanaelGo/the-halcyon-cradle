### Quotes


>Wanderers, thieves, miscreants, or otherwise, heed our word as the once suffered scorn. Beyond this door there is no honor, prize, or valor. Any who enter will find it to be their final resting place. Turn back. Return from where you came and forget this journey lest you invoke wraths more ancient than even we. â€” Fallen Prince Iiedepus
