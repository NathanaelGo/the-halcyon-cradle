# Theory
"He is an original member of the institute - er well sorta -they are a creation of an original member of the institute" [https://youtu.be/SngEqd0GFVs?si=9jpDTDp9ixtIUbSm&t=10318](https://youtu.be/SngEqd0GFVs?si=9jpDTDp9ixtIUbSm&t=10318 "https://youtu.be/SngEqd0GFVs?si=9jpDTDp9ixtIUbSm&t=10318") 
"You see his head tilt back - half a second later an alien sound comes out - a second later a translation comes out" [https://youtu.be/SngEqd0GFVs?si=7tX3uz72IFXYEf7g&t=10745](https://youtu.be/SngEqd0GFVs?si=7tX3uz72IFXYEf7g&t=10745 "https://youtu.be/SngEqd0GFVs?si=7tX3uz72IFXYEf7g&t=10745") 

Some founding member escaped into space (possibly during the big explosion that wiped out Noctis) and is communicating to our world via this puppet body. (As it takes time for the signal to transmit to the body/get translated much like the voices in Marais head need tuning/translation)
