### Summary
Was a Medusa 
Part of [[Virilyk]]
Got turned into a dungeon
[[Asska]] has her bow

>  Here lies no corpses, no artifacts. Only Sin is buried here. I became the stone that guards this tomb of secrets. By not turning back you choose death. 
>
>Our tale is curated by our destroyer. I will convey what I am permissed. May you find solace in my parting condolences. 
>
>I was Laresia, Medusian champion of the Codexica Dominion in the 82nd century of the Aeon of Light. Our order, [[Virilyk]], pursued knowledge of the ancient kingdom of Gnosisia. What we uncovered earned us the ire of remnant vestiges of Noctis, another, more recent, fallen empire.
>
>We were offered an opportunity of tremendous sacrifice and glory. We declined. In retaliation, our benefactors hunted us down one by one. To preserve the lands with which our warring wrought havoc we negotiated an armistice with our destroyer. Our party of nine, reduced by then to three, was dealt its death knell. 
>
>Virilyk’s leader, Ankathryn, willingly sacrificed herself. Virilyk’s wizard, Tomelot, was forcibly donned the armor of madness. I, Virilyk’s oracle, willingly became this tomb. 
>
>Ankathryn gave her life to spare her lover, these lands, and pass our Sin down to you. In our time, Sin are acts which invoke gods’ wrath and bring despair, even beyond the grave. We believe the importance of passing on the torch supersedes our mortal frame. We, ignorant of Gnosisia's fears, beseech you in your doom. What rests here may hold value beyond our recognition.
>
>Gnosisia existed. 
>
>Gnosisia was destroyed. 
>
>The catalyst to [[Gnosisia]]’s fall was Sin in the ancient capital of [[Pandora]]. 
>
>The Gnosisian’s could control the light of Ilios.
>
>The Gnosisian’s golden age was marked by the beginning of the Aeon of Light.
>
>The Gnosisians feared a calamity that would befall our world.
>
>Gnosisia created the Medusians to preserve history.
>
>I was a Medusian.
>
>I have preserved history.
