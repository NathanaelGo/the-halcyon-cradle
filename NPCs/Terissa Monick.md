Claims to not be our foe



  
“A schism will forge and bring forth a star's quake, and with their ripples it will tear newly a fabric that is just yet born. If ripped entirely asunder there will be peace, but of which it will surely bore. Do nothing and failure is ensured. A final misstep not one can endure. The book you must read, if it should come to pass, will never, ever open.”
