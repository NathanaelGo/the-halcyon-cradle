### Summary
Destroyed and no longer apart of this world. 

The destroyed sin might be Nihilism
1. [[Deus Green Guy|Green Guy]] mentioned in lock step with [[Acedia|Apathy]] here:
	1. they have stopped at nothing to try and fight against a fate so grand and so beyond them and even though in their darkest hour they learned the truth a truth that in past has made many succumb to **apathy** or even **nihilism** they have still sought a fire and within their own chest to burn and incinerate everything around them
2. Nihilism is a negative emotion that's on par with the rest of the sins
3. You know what's not part of our world? The very thing that is established as not our world? The empty space that fills the very void? [[The Planes|Nihil]]
