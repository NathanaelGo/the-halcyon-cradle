# Letter to Jenkins

And y’know, Jenkins? This deal between you and boss man, it goes two ways, capiche? He ain’t so pleased, with, uh, the expediency of, y’know, that. Dumping these digs so suddenly is a BIG loss, after all. He’s gettin’ a bitta… grumpy. Ya.   

I think we gotta compromise on this table, here. How ‘boutcha ya meet ‘em halfway?  Those garden frolickies poking around are makin’ slow work for the boys. Get ‘em to shove those stars up theirs. One less thing to muck up the auction. And do boss man anotha solid — he needs those circles.

Big Green sends his regards.
