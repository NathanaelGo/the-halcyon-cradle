### Designations

[[Mylàrin Ulamoor]]
[[Dazzle]]
Originates from the Island of Mists

___
### Summary
Brain worm that transmits 
Experiment by the republic to recreate technology owned by Veganox. Entire nebula isle (wasn't always nebulas) 
Mind will shatter if it leaves you (according to [[White]])

"A king doesn't let his Pawn declare war" in reference to [[Mylàrin Ulamoor]]
Wants to see what happens to [[Mylàrin Ulamoor|Mylàrin]] when he goes into a [[Ragnarok]] (melt and die OR some mega change OR the coin lands on its side...)


Manifested in a physical form and only showed himself because he wanted to help us with the [[The Zignus Institute|The Institute]]

Made on the isle of mist. Nebulae (after it went wrong) 
Vega nox isn't dead, [[Adazgul]] was an attempt to clone him. The [[Wards]] are a piece of them. Republic got the pieces and tried to make their own Vega Nox. 
Has some of [[Vega Nox]]'s memory. 

Looking for [[Ragnarok]] researches in [[Codex]] (stole Adazgul's research notes)

[[Harpokrates]] might have researched him too but forgot. 

Disappears the moment Vega Nox comes back. 

Wants to be real.
Can probably only take root in 100-1000s heads. (cant spread too thin)

Adazguls in other people are considered his brothers

Once enough of adazguls are in place there might be an adazgul battle royale. (battle to get real)
[[Mylàrin Ulamoor]]'s Adazgul can absorb others now.
