### Summary
Associate of [[The Doctor]]
Shows up when [[Sin]] reaches a precipice 
Conferred with [[Nythlani Eristil|Apricot]] about the [[Raven's Order]]

Was met twice at the [[Warden Trials]] and with [[The Doctor]].

He talked to the party during the Warden Trials, telling them this:

> You have arrived at a place before time, and before time without place. You are not the first, nor will you be the last. However, unique in your time, you stand before it. 
>
> We deliver tides unto you, wanderers of the Halcyon Cradle. A confluence of possibilities in your era has forged a schism in our instrumentality. The greatest fissure of this incident will be imminently forged here, by you. Our forward march ceased with your step and we cannot advance until you converge the looms of time once more. We make our appeal to this age through you. Haste is cautioned and rumination is advised.
>
> What disrupts determinism is unknown to us. You are the foreshadow of agency and a precursor to irreversible conflict. If ignored, you will shape history at the epicenter of its destruction. Our request is boundless: prevent the meeting between Gremory and Sitri. When and where this will be is unknown to us. Preserve yourselves and your world until the opportunity to merge fates presents itself. 
> 
> We share the utmost possible without jeopardizing our mission and our knowledge imposes risk upon you. Make note of such heeds and maintain clandestine operations in their regard. Sitri is your only enemy within the network. Baal and Zepar are inimical to your interests. Astaroth and Vreal may aid or sabotage, nothing more. Gremory and Paimonia are your only allies within the network.


Gods want to kill this man, Gods from other worlds want to do so as well.
