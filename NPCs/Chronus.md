### Summary
Associate of [[The Doctor]] - Might not be - just showed up in the [[Crier's Ladder]] with him and [[Deus Green Guy|Green Guy]]
Shows up when [[Sin]] reaches a precipice 
Conferred with [[Nythlani Eristil|Apricot]] about the [[Raven's Order]]

Was met twice at the [[Warden Trials]] and with [[The Doctor]].

He talked to the party during the Warden Trials, telling them this:

> You have arrived at a place before time, and before time without place. You are not the first, nor will you be the last. However, unique in your time, you stand before it. 
>
> We deliver tides unto you, wanderers of the [[Ilios|Halcyon Cradle]]. A confluence of possibilities in your era has forged a schism in our instrumentality. The greatest fissure of this incident will be imminently forged here, by you. Our forward march ceased with your step and we cannot advance until you converge the looms of time once more. We make our appeal to this age through you. Haste is cautioned and rumination is advised.
>
> What disrupts determinism is unknown to us. You are the foreshadow of agency and a precursor to irreversible conflict. If ignored, you will shape history at the epicenter of its destruction. Our request is boundless: prevent the meeting between [[Deus Gremory|Gremory]] and [[Sitri|Sitri]]. When and where this will be is unknown to us. Preserve yourselves and your world until the opportunity to merge fates presents itself. 
> 
> We share the utmost possible without jeopardizing our mission and our knowledge imposes risk upon you. Make note of such heeds and maintain clandestine operations in their regard. [[Sitri]] is your only enemy within the network. [[Baal]] and [[Zepar|Zepar]] are inimical to your interests. [[Deus Green Guy|Astaroth]] and [[Vreal]] may aid or sabotage, nothing more. [[Deus Gremory|Gremory]] and [[Paimonia]] are your only allies within the network.

> Terminus Gates is we

> As long as we make choices in our world that benefit determinism you will come to pass that you have the utmost agency or restore order to all of our sin. As the timelines converge once again we will continue on our way.

It has been Eons since their last appearance. They only appear when time is divergent. 

> Be wary to those who came to be of [[Promethia]], If true will be your friend. If not they will be your enemy

Gods want to kill this man, Gods from other worlds want to do so as well.
Related to [[Promethia]]
Only appears when sin is at its greatest. Intervenes and meddles.


Mortality itself is being brought before a judge.
Instigator that will bring about a conflict that raises the question "Is this worlds existence worth it".
Bad things happen when they pop up. - Source [[Deus Astaroth|Green Guy]]

Seen by [[Pandora]] with [[Vega Nox]] while meeting [[Paimonia]] after Vega Nox conquered Codex

[[The Zignus Institute|The Institute]] wants us to ask him the following question: "The coordinates we require on [[Blazur]] and [[Valtara]]" (message has been passed down to 8000 years - context has be lost - probably somewhere on Illios)
