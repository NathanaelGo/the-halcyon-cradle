### These steps do NOT allow you to contribute
You will only be able to see what's in the notes and download updates! Any local change will NOT be synchronized with the notes on github, and will exist only on your local computer.**
See below on how to contribute.

### Syncing up changes

With Obsidian open, you should see a button with two lines-and-circles (if you hover over it, it should say "Open Git source control"). Click on it. 

If there's any change available in the notes, you should see the "Pull" button lit up at the top-right, in a newly opened panel (it's a downward arrow, classic "Download" button). By clicking on it, you'll sync up with any change made to the notes.


## How to contribute

Contributing requires you to fork the repository with your own github account, making whatever edit you want to make and creating a pull request on the original repo.
