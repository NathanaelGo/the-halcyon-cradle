### Summary
Major city in the [[Scion Union]], on a bend of the Marsind.

### Events
The party arrived here aboard the [[Cabin Light]], traveling down the Marsind. Their main objective in town is to help [[Asska]] eliminate [[Barry Jenkins]] from the political scene and with that end the persecution against the [[Ssassik Tribe]] and the other tribes of the [[Blackmire Swamp]].

Using the authority of Union Senator [[Ashley Anne Helsing]], they started investigating on the refusal to help [[Erymnos]] during the beginning of the [[Hymns Crisis]]. 

[[Ravane Soga'tae|Ravane]] inspected Jenkins's house while [[Mylàrin Ulamoor|Mylàrin]] and Ashley went looking for his financial advisor. Thanks to a box Ravane found, the party now has proof that various documents have been forged and only need to pin the murder and silencing of {{Insert financial advisor name here}} on Barry to have him arrested.

[[Morai]] and [[Asska]] had a talk with [[Kathy Swindial]], finding out about an auction for [[Uncertainty Weapon|Uncertainty Weapons]]. This auction has been organized by a certain [[Saw]] on behalf of [[The Doctor]]. They have been given a place and date to get help and find out more.

[[John Cowboy|John]] talked with [[Portman Teeterson]] (Jenkins's political opponent in the oncoming mayor election) and his friend [[Terissa Monick]]. They are actually [[Orion]] members and plan to hand the city to a Knight of the Union after winning.

In the city, [[Deus Gremory|Grey Dormeous]] offered Mylàrin access to her personal [[Gremory's Library|library]]. She also offered the party [[Authority]] to go deeper into the library and avoid being terminated for accumulating too much [[Sin]]
