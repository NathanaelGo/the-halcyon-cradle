### Summary
Colossal library demiplane the party has been granted access to. It can be accessed from any major library in Ilios by operating a specific book.

The library contains basically every book ever written and all the knowledge accumulated by mortals over the ages. It is divided in levels, zero through ten, and only people with enough [[Sin]] can access the deeper levels. The deeper you go, the higher your Sin has to be.

[[Equinox (The Party)|The Party]] can access Levels 0 and 1. Lower levels are locked behind receiving [[Authority]], an act that drenches you in Sin.

One can check if they are ready for the next level if they read the last book before the access stairs and feel nothing.

[[Equinox (The Party)|The Party]] 3rd Level Access
[[Myl√†rin Ulamoor]] 4th Level Access

Reaching the 7th level will illuminate much.
Reaching the 10th level will reveal all.
