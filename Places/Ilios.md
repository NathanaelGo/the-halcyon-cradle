The world as we know today. 

* Light comes and goes as it pleases, unrelated to the movements of the sun. The Sun is a pale sphere in the sky just like the two moons (Solace and Sable). While the days usually follow a circadian timing, there sometimes are periods when light or dark last for multiple day-cycles. 
	* This phenomenon is commonly referred to as [[Nyxian's Din]] and has supposedly divine origin.
	* The world is still recovering from a period of a hundred years of dark called "[[The Long Night]]", which lasted until 30 years before the start of the campaign.
	* The world has been recently plunged into darkness again.
	* The party has been informed by multiple sources that Nixian's Din is actually connected to a specific person ([[Din Bearer]]), which is currently in a controlled coma. How this person is chosen or determined is unknown. 
* [[Hekate's Hymns]] are outbursts of cursed song that plague the land. 
	* This melody causes heavy mutations in both fauna and flora, and prolonged exposure is often deadly. 
	* The occurrence of hymns is random in both location and strength. Weaker hymns disappear faster, while stronger ones can last days or even weeks.
