## Final Resting Place
![[img_borons_resting_place.png]]

Here lies Boron of Equinox
Felled in battle fighting courageously for his comrades

To some: A mighty Cleric of Aurelia's Faith
To others: A Twilight Watcher of feathered beauty
To those of Equinox: The greatest ally and friend we could ever ask for

Rest Well.
