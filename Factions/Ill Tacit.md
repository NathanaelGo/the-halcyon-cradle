Gackt: tall, black, stark reds, belt loops, similar chains
Ms. Sevenths: Fairly regular adventurer elf woman. Could change her appearance on a dime likely
Ruby Skinner: Very offputting. Very attractive body hidden under grotesque metals and a large hat that covers her eyes. Has a large sickle or something.
Scurvy Bang: Seen pictures of him. He is, if I recall, has one arm and wears a blindfold.
White: Dresses in black, has long white hair. Very imposing aura. Nervewracking to be around. You won't not notice him. Human, long lived.
