### Summary
High powered party
Party of 9

>I was Laresia, Medusian champion of the Codexica Dominion in the 82nd century of the Aeon of Light. Our order, [[Virilyk]], pursued knowledge of the ancient kingdom of [[Gnosisia]]. What we uncovered earned us the ire of remnant vestiges of [[Noctis Empire|Noctis]], another, more recent, fallen empire.
>
>We were offered an opportunity of tremendous sacrifice and glory. We declined. In retaliation, our benefactors hunted us down one by one. To preserve the lands with which our warring wrought havoc we negotiated an armistice with our destroyer. Our party of nine, reduced by then to three, was dealt its death knell. 
>
>Virilyk’s leader, Ankathryn, willingly sacrificed herself. Virilyk’s wizard, Tomelot, was forcibly donned the armor of madness. I, Virilyk’s oracle, willingly became this tomb. 
>
>Ankathryn gave her life to spare her lover, these lands, and pass our Sin down to you. In our time, Sin are acts which invoke gods’ wrath and bring despair, even beyond the grave. We believe the importance of passing on the torch supersedes our mortal frame. We, ignorant of Gnosisia's fears, beseech you in your doom. What rests here may hold value beyond our recognition.
