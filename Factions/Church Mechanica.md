A dual worship church for [[Deus Sellenaia]], the Divine Imperatrix of Moons, and [[Deus Zignus]], the Divine Imperator of Stars managed by Astrologer [[Bellaria Petric]] of House Petric. There are two observatories, each being one of the largest in the whole world, and they use cutting edge technologies to peer deeper than ever before into the starry abyss above. The Church of Mechanica was built over a three year period and was finished less than a year ago. Previously, the grounds belonged to the disgraced House Arafiel.
