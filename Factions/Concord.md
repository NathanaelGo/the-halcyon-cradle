Previously known as the Borderlands, a semi-independent region north of the Lyssandre Plains under [[Codexica Dominion]] influence but with almost complete autonomy.

After the Dominion tried sending their military to better take hold of the region and possibly force themselves into taking control of the [[Ward of Paragon]] in the area, [[The Twins]] stopped the oncoming army and declared the place an independent country.
