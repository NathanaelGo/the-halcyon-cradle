A set of powerful wards protected by [[Aurora]]

They have been made by the Noctis Empire in an attempt to save parts of the world from the [[Cataclysm]]

Each Ward is linked to a [[Warden]]

One such wand is in the [[Concord|Borderlands]]

Wards of Paragon are powered by parts of [[Vega Nox]] body, much like [[Adazgul]] was made with one of the ribs of Vega Nox
