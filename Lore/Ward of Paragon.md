* [[Integra]] - Borderlands
* [[Malachi Grimora]], Emperor of the Umbrean Empire
* [[Zenaida Grimora]]
* [[Calpurnia Grimora]]


A set of powerful wards protected by [[Aurora]]

They have been made by the Noctis Empire in an attempt to save parts of the world from the [[Cataclysm]]

Each Ward is linked to a [[Ward of Paragon]]

One such wand is in the [[Concord|Borderlands]]

Wards of Paragon are powered by parts of [[Vega Nox]] body, much like [[Adazgul]] was made with one of the ribs of Vega Nox

A shield that will block the blast of the [[Cataclysm]] and redirect it into the Ocean

Will be given lordship over their own lands

Union Empire Federation and Faith know what these are
Dominion does not (session 25)

The Wardens of the [[Ward of Paragon]] are those responsible for activating the Ward when the [[Cataclysm]] happens.

When called they must answer the summons - happens once every couple hundred years and lasts a few weeks
