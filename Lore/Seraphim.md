A seraphine is going to be born soon?
Mentioned in [[Morai]]'s note.

5th level of the library 

Seraphim births occur about every 36k years

If the gods don't stop their birth they get scolded pretty damn hard (DEATH) by [[Architects]]

Gods jobs are to facilitate the birth of Seraphim

Newer worlds birth seraphim faster

Couple thousand can fight a hoard (quintillions) of [[Avernis]]

When born absorbs lumina from the world inherits a curse: (lasting 50k-5k?? years)
- [[Hekate's Hymns]] 
- Night and Day
- Another one which seams to be erased - [[Paimonia]]

Next Seraphim birth - a few months to 2 years

Culmination of all life forms who died which are imprinted into a hallowed out case of Nihil
Given an existence into fighting their creators - [[Architects]] trick them into fighting [[Avernis]]

[[Core]] is the machine that will birth the Seraphim

Explosions comes from underneath the [[Citadel of light]] - birthing place of the Seraphim
