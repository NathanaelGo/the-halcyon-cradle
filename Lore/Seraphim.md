A seraphine is going to be born soon?
Mentioned in [[Morai]]'s note.

5th level of the library 

Seraphim births occur about every 36k years

If the gods don't stop their birth they get scolded pretty damn hard (DEATH) by [[Architects]]

Gods jobs are to facilitate the birth of Seraphim

Newer worlds birth seraphim faster

Couple thousand can fight a hoard (quintillions) of [[Avernis]]

When born absorbs lumina from the world inherits a curse: (lasting 50k-5k?? years)
