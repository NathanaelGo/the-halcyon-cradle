[[Ilios]] holding a sword ([[Light of Chaos]]) and unknown. 
Sable and Solace are reaching/shooting unknown.
[[Ilios]] was called the cursed one here. Sable and Solace their watchful protector.
Many despise what Ilios holds. The womb of a great threat. The knowledge of [[Sin]]
## The Moons
Ilios orbits a star similar to our sun. Unlike Earth, two moons orbit Ilios: Solace and Sable. Both moons and the stars are only visible when a “natural night” coincides with darkness produced by Nyxian. Their star, referred to generally as “the sun”, can be perfectly eclipsed by Sable and easily eclipsed by Solace. While the temperature drops during an eclipse, light levels are not impacted. Both moons are tidally locked with Ilios. 
It is believed by many that when the Divine Imperators crafted Ilios they made Sable to take on the woes of life and Solace to comfort Sable in times of strife.

The idea of representing the moons as people is an idea taken from the [[Noctis Empire]]. Modern day they are not represented as people.

## Solace
Light blue and speckled with craters 

## Sable
Light green with half of its face clear of craters and the other half littered with them. A large visible division between the two halves can be seen, which many interpret as the two faces of Solace; the nurturer and the resilient.
