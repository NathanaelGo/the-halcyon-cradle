Realm of impossibility 
Contains the realms of magic 



### Abstraxia, the domain of Inner Chaos
An individual’s subconscious can transcend the restrictions of reality, allowing them to tap into Essentia directly. Typically through a combination of natural born talent and extensive practice, a person steers their subconscious, giving them a loose connection to Abstraxia. Once achieved, one’s Lumina can be utilized. Techniques and processes used to harness Abstraxia are hardly uniform and many who perform magic through Abstraxia comprehend their abilities on a level too deep and abstract to put into words.

  

### Malifex, the domain of Centered Principle
Methodology, accuracy, and tremendous study can give rise to techniques that let one utilize their Lumina. Rather than treat magic like an art, those who familiarize themselves with Malifex tackle the challenge of tapping into Essentia with a scientific approach. Delicate and precise practices are studied and perfected, each with the goal of breathing variables into the universe that produce predictable results. Once mastered, these skills become routine acts of honed magic.

  

### Tellurian, the domain of Outward Harmony
When discipline and talent come up short, Essentia can be tapped into with a guiding hand. Lumina gives structure to the soul, and as such, magic entails reaching into one’s own soul. Powerful entities, alive and not, can affix themselves to others, linking their souls and Solipsys together. Tellurian is the domain of the nonliving and can be accessed by sharing a connection to another entity or patron. How this entity offers guidance varies with some connections being direct translations of the entity’s own abilities of Abstraxia or Malifex while others only push the helpee along so that they can more easily access Abstraxia or Malifex themselves. Due to the nature of this helping process, powerful entities can form vast Tellurian networks.

#### Pandemonium, the domain of Outer Chaos
- Chaos is an anomalous and amorphous [[Solipsys]] forged by the catalyst of entropy. [[Hekate's Hymns]] are attributed to [[Pandemonium, the domain of Outer Chaos]]
