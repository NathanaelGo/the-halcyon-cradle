## Planes of Existence
There exist seven extra dimensions of space. Five are collectively known as the Planes of Time, sometimes referred to as the Planes of Decay. These five dimensions, commonly called planes, can be visited. Time passes differently in each plane, so when a creature returns to their native plane the elapsed time for them will differ from others. This extends beyond perception as their Lumina will deteriorate at a rate matching the plane they visited, resulting in corresponding aging. Beyond the Planes of Time, a sixth dimension exists that is both reciprocatory and unbound to existing physicality. This marks it as a useful and unique plane, albeit with heavy limitations attached. Lastly, there is a collection of extra dimensions known seldomly by the most esteemed scholars of the world. This particularly ambiguous dimensional space is collectively known as the Voidscape of Nihility and is where any and all Nihil planes are found.


### Physical Properties of the Planes of Time
Each of the Planes of Time reflects the physicality of Veritas, the Substantia Plane, and exists in, spatially, the exact same position. These mirror worlds perfectly overlap each other, invisible to all but the most planarly attuned. However, due to the individual natures of the planes, they are hardly alike. Any denizen of each would describe the other planes as alien, especially so for those with drastically different time dilations. While erosion and material evolution through time do exist on every plane, whenever the mundane mass of the other planes differs too greatly from Veritas they undergo rapid reconfiguration, leading these planes to be places of imminent chaos.


### Tranquiline, the Hibernia Plane
The slowest plane and the only one where Lumina decays slower than Veritas. Here, time passes a fluctuating 500 to 1000 times slower.

### Veritas, the Substantia Plane
The second slowest plane and also the one that contains “reality” for the inhabitants of the natural world. Almost everything that is known to exist is within Veritas.

### Equidiem, the Axis Plane
The third slowest plane and the one closest to Veritas in terms of Lumina deterioration rate. Here, time passes a fluctuating 5 to 10 times faster.

### Celerity, the Rapidus Plane
The fourth slowest plane. Time passes frighteningly quickly here, resulting in the deterioration of one’s Lumina at a worryingly accelerated rate. Time passes a fluctuating 50 to 100 times faster.

### Abyssia, the Atrophy Plane
The fifth slowest, or in other words fastest plane and furthest from Tranquiline. Time here passes a fluctuating 25,000 to 50,000 times faster. An average day in Abyssia equates to over 100 years in Veritas, meaning that every precious second spent here counts.

### Serenith, the Stasis Plane
A plane unbound to time and the other planes. Time does not conventionally pass within Serenith, but Lumina evaporates off of some things that visit it, including life. Due to this, many objects can be stored in Serenith and avoid erosion indefinitely while others can deteriorate tens or even hundreds of times faster than whichever plane the entrance or gateway to Serenith resides in. This dimension, unlike the Planes of Time, can be accessed physically through magical means, such as portals, imbued objects, and so forth.

### Voidscape of Nihility
The Voidscape of Nihility can be summarily described as a vacuum. While the physical universe is virtually empty at the subatomic level, the exact absence of anything marks the Voidscape of Nihility. It exists in the form of the infinite expanse between the Planes of Time, as well as in any vacuum found in the material world. In other words, supposing space is a vacuum, it would be part of the Voidscape of Nihility.

### Nihil
Within the Voidscape of Nihility are countless pocket dimensions of tangled up nothingness defined only by entropy, or a lack thereof. These planes are known collectively as Nihil. Unlike Serenith, which is unbound to time, Nihil is influenced by what resides in it. Natively, time does not exist in Nihil and nothing ever changes, but Lumina, which is foreign to Nihil, introduces entropy and thus dictates the flow of time within it. In other words, the arrow of time is born through the introduction of Lumina into Nihil. This makes these planes highly adaptable seeing as they reciprocate entropy. In theory, one with sufficient ability could theoretically custom tailor entire worlds within it.
  

### Planar Travel
Fundamentally speaking, Lumina native to the Planes of Time cannot easily traverse their neighboring overlapping planes. This is a two part problem. 

First, Lumina native to the Planes of Time is locally calibrated. Much like a creature evolved to survive at certain pressures, without proper considerations any foreign Lumina is at serious risk of being distorted, outright dissipated, or rejected back onto its native plane. Second, the Voidscape of Nihility separates each of the Planes of Time. Like unforgiving seas which bridge distant continents together, the vacuum of the Voidscape is in of itself an arduous hurdle that any planar traveler must overcome. The problem here lies in one’s own Lumina. It will inherently alter Nihil, creating a profile mirroring their native plane. Attempts to jump from one calibration to the next will simply end in the Lumina circling immediately back to where it started. With this in mind, there are four methods of traversing the Voidscape of Nihility between the Planes of Time:

1. Lumina attunement to the desired plane. In the same vein that one might reject themselves back onto their native plane, one can artificially match the profile of another plane and be directionally “rejected” onto that plane instead.
2. Adopt a Lumina profile matching the Void of Nihility itself. That is, Lumina that encompasses nothing.
3. Avoid Nihil. While the Voidscape of Nihility is littered to the brim with countless tangled dimensional planes that, when encountered, will send unprepared travelers back to their native plane, it is theoretically possible to avoid these.
  4. Begin from a starting point within the Voidscape of Nihility. If one could theoretically enter a vacuum before attempting planar travel their “starting point” would be registered as the Voidscape of Nihility.
  

For these reasons, virtually all means of planar travel require incredibly advanced and powerful technologies. To circumnavigate these challenges, rather than traverse the Planes of Time themselves, mages have developed methods of projection and raw energy transference. In this way, a person still exists on their native plane, but is able to simultaneously wander other Planes of Time while their original self is inactive in an unconscious state. If an individual is destroyed on another plane they typically return to their native plane, but in some cases suffer worse fates.
