The stars are fake and can speak to people.

Possibly the same as the Aetheria Network, or a part of it.

The secret behind the stars can be found in the 10th floor of [[Gremory's Library]]

[[Morai]]'s Voices are poorly translated and unfiltered. Needs to be refined.

Image of a real thing but at this point entirely false.
