Gold has a mind of its own
In goldâ€™s case, gold is finite and will always surface. Whether it takes decades, centuries, or even millennia, gold will always return to the world.

The [[Warden Dungeon]] [[Equinox (The Party)|The Party]] got a lot of gold there. It might be a respawn point.

[[Iidepus|The Scorned Prince]] has some connection?


[[John Cowboy|John]]'s gold requires to have a gold on person to stay attuned to it
