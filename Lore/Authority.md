Something the gods can give out.  You can probably only have the authority of one god. 

Patronage from a god that allows you to investigate and do sin without being blasted by another god. 

Hall pass to search for sin

Mixing and matching between the gods can nullify it

Authority can be given for actions. 
Some gods don't like authority and will ignore it
