Lasting Will


Will of Light's Ire
>Your body has become a prison of the endless depths, and you its jailor. From head to toe, scale to sheath, white encompasses your being. The darkest of blacks transform into mere hollowed shades of divisible grey and even magic items soften, or outright douse all color from their spectra. When you bleed it is black; an open mouth, the abyss. Light itself curses you. The coat you now forever wear is but an emptiness, that of which born of darkness, given fulfilled form by the universe abound. You are white, for beneath is a blackness of the void which ravenously coalesces all manner of luminosity.
 
>Imagine so, light's only woe, a dark so dark it beckons radiant's tow. Light mourns not neither its disdain nor eviction, but mark certain its ire, an unbreakable conviction. It loathes any depth it cannot reach. A curse to its eternity, a prison it cannot breach.

White Insight:
> You gain the ability to gleam more from those naturally blessed with light's hoard. The shell of all that is nothing bestows thanks for its treasury. A depthless nothing has been freed and sight into the peerless cosmos becomes a realm of your own machination.
