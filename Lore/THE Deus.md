1 god - 2 upon a time


3 Kinds of gods: 
- those who are allowed
- those who are not
- and those who are above it all
	- Architects will strike the gods down if the step out of line

The [[Core]] is a place where a lot of gods are hiding. 
- Some [[THE Deus]] didn't want to play by the rule 
- Gods want out of the network
- Gods are running from something ([[Architects]])
- The core is one of the safest places for these gods


20 are so irregulars (disconnected from the network)

One regular is helping

With in the nexus there are 1000 Sentinel - ANN Sentinel - [[Aetheria Nexus Network]] Sentinel
