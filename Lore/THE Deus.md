3 Kinds of gods: 
- those who are allowed
- those who are not
- and those who are above it all
	- Architects will strike the gods down if the step out of line

The [[Core]] is a place where a lot of gods are hiding. 
- Some [[THE Deus]] didn't want to play by the rule 
- Gods want out of the network
- Gods are running from something ([[Architects]])
- The core is one of the safest places for these gods
