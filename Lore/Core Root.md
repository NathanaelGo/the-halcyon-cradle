TL;DR magic mushrooms that go suuuper far down 

- Ancient plant made by magic from an Old Hymn 
- Sentient plant
- Few places where it sprouts (not consistent)
	- Can appear for years or just days
- Made a promise (500+ years ago) to an ancient republic prince known as [[Iidepus|The Scorned One]] in the Incandescence wilds/[[Concord|Borderlands]]. Imbued that part of the world with magic to protect the [[Ward of Paragon]]
- Dominion is interested
