Gods don't like it. - Its considered a crime in regards to the Smoking Gun :)

The gods keep the world moving in a certain way. Sin is the act of deviating from that path and making choices that steers the world away from the direction the gods wants it to go.

Gods are trying to reduce the number of 'timeline' branches. (Sin creates the branches)

If you reach a threshold in sin, the gods will show up and vaporize you. [[Authority]] allows you to bypass it.

Pain, Stillness and Patience is repentance. 

Non optimal - decisions made with the heart

Crimes against the gods

- **(SIN 3)** Sin is a measure of influence over divergence; individuals, objects, and actions that fracture timelines away from a pre-defined base line.
- **(SIN 4)** [[Deus Gremory]] established a planet wide non-automatic detection system that can be tapped into by local Solipsys to inspect relative Solipsys reverberations in real time measured against standard variables spread across Ilios; sufficient divination and or computational ability, alongside longer analysis and more data points, allows for greater prediction of certainty and severity.
- **(SIN 5--NO ACCESS)** Information pertaining to accessing Gremory's Mesh.
- **(SIN 6--NO ACCESS)** Information pertaining to the establishment of Gremory's Mesh.
