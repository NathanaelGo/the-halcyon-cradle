Gods don't like it.

The gods keep the world moving in a certain way. Sin is the act of deviating from that path and making choices that steers the world away from the direction the gods wants it to go.

Gods are trying to reduce the number of 'timeline' branches. (Sin creates the branches)

If you reach a threshold in sin, the gods will show up and vaporize you. [[Authority]] allows you to bypass it.

Pain, Stillness and Patience is repentance.
