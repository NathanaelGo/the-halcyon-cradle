### Synopsis


### Details
Hekamonia the 2nd (6th loop, cont.)
The party is asked to meet with a high priestess of [[Zytus]], but before they have a chance to talk [[Adazgul]] ruins everything.

They get to the docks, where they reconvene with [[Ravane Soga'tae|Ravane]]. They then find out from [[Dazzle]] that the teleportation runes were kept in the monster house the party burned down.

The party heads to the new monster house and destroys it, retrieving notes with new runes on them.
