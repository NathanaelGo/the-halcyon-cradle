### Synopsis

[[Vreal|Larev]] met with John and Ravane after John asked questions he shouldn't have into his book

The party went to [[Flitty]]s Philters to try to cure [[Grian]] of his mind blank issue. While there [[Vaery]] an ally sent by [[Nythlani Eristil|Apricot]] and [[Dazzle]] met with the party along with a lot of the [[Stiletto Court]] telling them they didnt find us. We learned about the [[Codex Resistance]] and some contacts.

Went to Belial’s Directory and met with [[Ilimitar Valen]] to get more context on the city. He checked for [[Grian]]s death record (found none) and [[Ravane Soga'tae|Ravane]] ended up fining [[Corvyn Cain]] here as well. 

[[Mylàrin Ulamoor|Mylàrin]] found out his dad [[Silvus Ulamoor]] was 'dead' and his mom was alive but entered a depression Ark.

Ravane and John pivoted goals to cheer him up and located his mother at the big Codex Library and speaking with [[Cherry Sherry]] and learning his mom was OK he cheered up.

### Details

John preformed a commune to vreal using the Annals of Unwoven Banalities asking the following questions: 
1. Is King Kyrmin Dana (himself) infected/compromised by skin walkers? - No answer - apparently saving me alot of trouble,
2. Is the Din Bearer in Codex? - No
3. Have any mortals been invited to this upcoming meeting between the gods? - No

4. Is the first raven or the order of clowns responsible for the Hymns - No answer
5. Do most/all the gods have a primary order/objective they have to strive towards completing? - no answer - you already know
6. Are there more than 5 gods in codex right now? - yes

7. Are you expecting any major issues to pop up during your god council meeting? - probably not(?)
8. Is there a way to separate Skinwalker from host? - Can't answer
9. Do the gods retain memories that Return erases? - dont understand

Instead of reading the answers right away he set it aside for later as he went to contact the Twins in Concord. 

Sending a quick update to the twins John got back
G--- -- h---. We'-- ---- --u g-t -- ---e-. S----hi-g -ri- is ---p--ing -- Con-ord a- -- t-- p-s- 48 --u-s. S--y ----la-t.
Which we deciphered to mean: 
Good to hear. We're glad you got to codex, Something grim is happening in [[Concord]] as of the past 48 hours. Stay vigilant 

[[Vreal|Larev]] a follower of [[Deus Morrigan]] knocked on the door and greeted the room in the middle of the night (Weirdchamp) and asked if he could come inside (vampire-core). John agreed to which Larev casted some sort of silence spell and answered some of the questions in the book and warning John there's some questions he shouldn't be asking. He also claimed that if it weren't for the last question he would have just blown John up (FREE ME FROM THESE COWBOY CHAINS lmao). After asking but not really 'asking' John didn't want to involve the sleeping [[Maxwell Barrows|Maxwell]] in more combat after he was almost splattered by a demon the fight before and shared some basic info on Return. Larev also claimed to have saved John in the past and claims that he was a good bet to give that book to. :clueless:

After meeting with [[Flitty]] to try to cure [[Grian]] of his mind blank issue, [[Vaery]] and a bunch of the [[Stiletto Court]] arrived. We previously contacted [[Vaery]] that morning because [[Dazzle]] mentioned her being an ally the day before. After sending the Court away Vaery took us aside and discussed what the hell was going on in the city. We learned of the [[Codex Resistance]] a fragmented grass roots organization and a few contacts inside it [[Ilimitar Valen]] and [[Jane|One Slice Jane]]. 

With the party disguised as elfs via a seeming spell, our next stop Belial’s Directory where we met with [[Ilimitar Valen]]. He's too useful to cut despite the knowledge he holds. He noticed the mind blank host preparation phenomenon of people in Codex a few years ago so this skinwalker issue runs deep and long. He checked for [[Grian]]s death record (found none) and [[Ravane Soga'tae|Ravane]] ended up finding [[Corvyn Cain]] here as well. Corvyn was looking for something and pulled down a book for [[Lilith Altair]], and after a bit of playful banter and Corvyn being reminded he still doesnt have his masters degree he vanished. 

Mylairin continued pursing the catalog of obituaries and found his fathers entry [[Silvus Ulamoor]] but not his mothers. [[Deus Green Guy|Green Guy]] previously told him that both his parents were alive but do you really trust the god of trickery? This sent Mylarin into a bit of a depressive spiral and the party racked their brain on how to pull him out of it.  

Gani mentioned how it would be easy to break his will (as she's done it countless times to people in the military in the past) but that breaks people and she cares too much about us to do that.

Using Smokes, Ravane and John located Mylarins mother and pivoted goals to unite the two and cheer him up.  The gun pointed towards the big Codex Library's restricted books section. The party was pointed to [[Cherry Sherry]] to gain permission and after [[Mylàrin Ulamoor|Mylàrin]] dropped his disguise Cherry believed us and told [[Equinox (The Party)|The Party]] that she was helping protect [[House Ulamoor]] and that Mama Mylarin was still alive.  Opening the book she is protected by should only be done if really needed so the next time some one is being added to the books protective realm Mylarin will get a call to go see his mom. After learning of this in combination with a rousing speech from Cherry, [[Mylàrin Ulamoor]]'s outward depression is no more.
