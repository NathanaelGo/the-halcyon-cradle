### Synopsis


### Details
Hekamonia the 2nd (6th loop)
Party went to meet with [[Dazzle]], had a fun time at the spa. Dazzle also has [[Adazgul]] and that makes it resurge in Myl√†rin's head. After convincing Dazzle to cooperate, she gave information about the monster house, and offered to give us teleport circle runes for the Briar family estate in the swamp.
Dazzle also has a weird rib from one of the people who are keeping the Din Bearer hostage, and Adazgul was the one who asked her to take it.

We alerted [[Kathy Swindial]] that [[Nythlani Eristil|Apricot]] is impersonating her and we are waiting to jump her again.

In the meantime, [[Ravane Soga'tae|Ravane]] localizes the Monster House again and the rest of the group goes to the garden of [[Zytus]].

[[Morai]] and [[John Cowboy|John]] get invited into a private room and talk with the priestess of Zytus.
Ravane finds the house and gets attacked.
