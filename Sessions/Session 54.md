### Synopsis


### Details
[[Ravane Soga'tae|Ravane]] searches for info about [[The Stars]], finds that the truth about them will be found at level 10 of [[Gremory's Library]]. He also searches info about the [[Core Root]]. The Root is protecting the Wards and it's sentient. The "Scorned Prince" (a monster we found at the [[Warden Trials]]) made a promise to it.

[[Mylàrin Ulamoor|Mylàrin]] finds that all people with [[Authority]] have been all dragged into conflicts, and those who live to the end of their lives are all [[Rex Apex|Rex Apexes]], strong enough not to be trifled with. He also finds that the [[Light of Chaos|Lights of Chaos]] are incredibly ancient (thousands of years).

[[Equinox (The Party)|The Party]] goes for lunch with [[Deus Gremory|Grey]]. [[John Cowboy|John]] and [[Morai]] ask a few questions, about dragons, about the gods, and about [[Authority]]. About half of the gods are indifferent to agency, while only her and [[Deus Astaroth]] are on the side of protecting agency.

Meeting with Vaaliz, they get tasked to find a crazy witch that killed multiple people. They will find her in the marshes, helped by Khafra.




Iiedepus, republican noble, wanted the Borderlands Ward to be even more hidden, and the Iiedepus Catacomb resets every 24 hours. Iiedepus was condemned to protect it forever. The architect of the Catacomb was not Iiedepus, they were the older Ward of Paragon: Minerva.

>Wanderers, thieves, miscreants, or otherwise, heed our word as the once suffered scorn. Beyond this door there is no honor, prize, or valor. Any who enter will find it to be their final resting place. Turn back. Return from where you came and forget this journey lest you invoke wraths more ancient than even we. — Fallen Prince Iiedepus
