### Synopsis
[[Equinox (The Party)|The Party]] woke up in a time loop. They talked with [[Terissa Monick]] and she said we would always die in two days no matter what. She sent a bunch of scouts to check the outside of [[Moros]].

They met [[Khafra Gild-Ra]] again, then went to look for [[Sebastian Flowers]] who attacked them on sight. [[Asska]] and [[John Cowboy|John]] killed him, but he revived later and chased the party down.

After escaping, the party tried to trap [[White]] to no avail. They escaped, and when [[Mylàrin Ulamoor|Mylàrin]] escaped off of the time loop area they met with a green robotic figure who reset the time loop.
