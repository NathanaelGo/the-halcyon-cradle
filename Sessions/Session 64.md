### Synopsis
After defeating [[White]], the party tries to take a break but not before getting vaporized by [[Deus Asura]] (or a replica of her) for trying to contact her.

They then shared [the memories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D4WY_8_G1YOUBw-kyuS3Yzv67fYQ8VkylCl05uekOCI/edit?usp=sharing) they acquired from each other over breakfast, went shopping for a bit and then stopped for a bath at the [[Bothered Miss]] bathhouse.

There, after some brief chat, the [[Deus Green Guy|Green Guy]] showed up and there were many talks about worldly and godly matters.

### Details

The party talked with the Green God about several things:

- There are multiple egg planets whose function is to birth seraphims
- There are gods of these multiple worlds, they don't know who made the worlds nor how to stop the process
- They act as sort of "guardians" of these worlds, though the vast majority doesn't really care about life on their surface and only starts considering them if...
- They are trying to make it so the future converges into a single timeline that they like and mortals can alter that, so they made a system to mostly track and squish down people who get too much agency.
- There are a few gods who don't agree with that, but they are in the minority and need to act quietly so their efforts don't get destroyed.
- Gremory is the more cautious one that made a whole system where mortals can get agency through a "safe process" that doesn't get instantly fucked if they step out of line...
- while Green Guy is more of a fuck it we ball individual that pushes people into the line of fire to see if they can dodge the bullet
- There are mortal-made weapons to kill gods that have the potential to ruin the gods' design for that one timeline, and the Doctor is trying to reconstruct them
- We have no idea what that single timeline the gods want entails
- The gods are "regulars" and "irregulars", and it seems like most/all of the gods we know are "irregulars"
- A lot of who the people call gods are just powerful dudes, much like rex apexes the definition only exists in people's minds
- [[Chronus]] pops up when there's going to be wild changes to the
