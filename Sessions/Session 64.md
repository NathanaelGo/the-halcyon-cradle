### Synopsis
After defeating [[White]], the party tries to take a break but not before getting vaporized by [[Deus Asura]] (or a replica of her) for trying to contact her.

They then shared [the memories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D4WY_8_G1YOUBw-kyuS3Yzv67fYQ8VkylCl05uekOCI/edit?usp=sharing) they acquired from each other over breakfast, went shopping for a bit and then stopped for a bath at the [[Bothered Miss]] bathhouse.

There, after some brief chat, the [[Deus Green Guy|Green Guy]] showed up and there were many talks about worldly and godly matters.

### Details

The party talked with the Green God about several things:

- There are multiple egg planets whose function is to birth seraphims
- There are gods of these multiple worlds, they don't know who made the worlds nor how to stop the process
- They act as sort of "guardians" of these worlds, though the vast majority doesn't really care about life on their surface and only starts considering them if...
- They are trying to make it so the future converges into a single timeline that they like and mortals can alter that, so they made a system to mostly track and squish down people who get too much agency.
- There are a few gods who don't agree with that, but they are in the minority and need to act quietly so their efforts don't get destroyed.
- Gremory is the more cautious one that made a whole system where mortals can get agency through a "safe process" that doesn't get instantly fucked if they step out of line...
- while Green Guy is more of a fuck it we ball individual that pushes people into the line of fire to see if they can dodge the bullet
- There are mortal-made weapons to kill gods that have the potential to ruin the gods' design for that one timeline, and the Doctor is trying to reconstruct them
- We have no idea what that single timeline the gods want entails
- The gods are "regulars" and "irregulars", and it seems like most/all of the gods we know are "irregulars"
- A lot of who the people call gods are just powerful dudes, much like rex apexes the definition only exists in people's minds
- [[Chronus]] pops up when there's going to be wild changes to the timelines



3:50:00 - Green guy insinuates he can make other races/future worlds 
3:54:30 - When someone reaches space 'KABOOM' 
4:00:30 - Us forgetting authority was a conscious choice of Not Green Guy (Why this in particular?) 
4:03:20 - Mylarin to make a vacuum 
4:07:20 - Can but doesn't meddle with the machinations of Piamonia 
4:23:45 - There have been times when authority was given against the rules (WHAT ARE DA RULES - did that happen at the banquet) 
4:30:30 - We got spectator chat (promethia/Chronus) watching us! 
4:32:00 - Regulars gods arent in on the loop about Chronus? 
4:33:15 - Mortality is being brought before a judge + Chronus is an instigator the will bring up the question - Is this planet worth existing 
4:39:07 - John needs ICE

Shads findings: 
"nobody knows I intervened due to what happened in the White fight" (the gods cannot see everything)
"there is something I want from you so of course I would help you"
the party (Morai?) needs to grow
"in some other era I could see you as part of a litigation where empires are toppled and governments are born" (tldr we are extraodinary individuals but the current times are full of extraordinary individuals)
"you are born at the third most possible interesting time"
"Asura is not a god but is a proxy(?) of something else?"
"The other gods have an objective you would not like. Asura doesn't care about you, she only cares that people don't go to space"
"You contend with once in a millennia and once in eons people"
"Gremory is one of the gods who truly wants good for us"
"The other gods make of their followers pawns marching to their doom, Gremory and I are the only ones who wish you to succeed or fail on our own"
"(About godly politics) There's a lot of bickering that happens at that table, and then there's another table that's a bit over there... we don't talk about that table"
"It's a meeting every couple thousand years, only between us irregulars. The regulars... we avoid the regulars."
"I have been to space. I have been beyond space, there's a space beyond space."
"Gremory had a premonition that (by not choosing authorithy together then and there) it would have led to separation and downfall."
"Most people who have authorithy have it from me or Gremory. The other gods don't have faith in you."
"There's a simple reason for the other gods' interventions: They intervene when sin is at its highest abundance but they don't like nudge the board."
"There's things you can do that the gods don't think you are capable of."
"Your little stunt at the banquet has rippled throughout this world. Many have heard of what you've done."
Very insistent on us getting Authority
"(Morrigan) wants less conflict. When there is less conflict, people become curious and find out things. It summons the most vile of consequences."
"You not knowing certain things is due to certain other regulations I have to abide to"
"For a god even lifting a finger will raise some eyebrows, and I didn't want to do that."
"If you ever split up your sin would fracture and disappear."
"some Mortals are strong enough to make the gods not exactly able to do what they want. Those few people who exist have rippling effects that cascade through time and diverge the lines of fate and those fate lines to this day have not been returned to one"
"the regulars do not play games (with Authority, or at all?)"
"(seraphim's birth) is something not even I can stop"
