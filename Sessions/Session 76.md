## Quotes and Notes

> [[Chronus]] have stopped at nothing to try and fight against a fate so grand and so beyond them and even though in their darkest hour they learned the truth a truth that in past has made many succumb to [[Acedia|Apathy]] or even [[Nihilism (theory)]] they have still sought a fire and within their own chest to burn and incinerate everything around them


> beyond a gap there is something that shadows this world **two things in fact that are responsible for making this world incomplete** there is even one who walks this world who tries their best ... **there is even one who walks this world whose main prerogative is to fix these gaps to fix these holes to bring a restored history a line** that is not broken so to answer your question yes there what has been lost and continues to be lost can never be gained again it is truly gone forever but but but but you can displace the lost with something - [[Deus Green Guy|Green Guy]]


> [referring to science-terms stashed in the library] dust carried by gods who are too clingy to things to be forgotten

Why was science supposed to be forgotten? So we can hard focus on magic and Lumina research as mortals? Talking about other worlds is safe at "the core" Can the gods not see the center of the world? Perhaps the core of the planet is something the architects set up and the gods are blacklisted from that site
