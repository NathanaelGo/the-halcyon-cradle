The session begins in [[Moros]], after a long rest at [[Glib Stop]]. This is the second day of the party being in the city.

[[Equinox (The Party)|The Party]] starts investigating on how to incriminate [[Barry Jenkins]] and save the [[Ssassik Tribe]]. After a brief breakfast meeting, they decide to split up to optimize their search and reconvene at the docks before midday.

#### Ravane breaks into Jenkins' house
[[Ravane Soga'tae|Ravane]] went to Barry Jenkins' house to look for incriminating evidence. After locating the place by bribing a postal office worker, he avoided the guards but was detected at the last minute while breaking in.

Using his connection with the shadows, he finds out there has been a murder and rushes to follow its traces. The visions tell about forgeries and crimes that will be found out. He gets into Barry's study and retrieves a suspicious box before making his escape jumping from roof to roof. On his way out, he gets hit by a dagger thrown by [[Rook Lennox]]. It left a minor scrying effect on him. 

#### Mylàrin and Ashley search incriminating documents
[[Mylàrin Ulamoor|Mylàrin]] and [[Ashley Anne Helsing]] group together and head to the Castle. They speak to the office workers there and get access to the archives, but quickly find out all documents have been taken by Jenkins' financial secretary.

They get sent into a wild goose chase, passing by a house that is in the same gated community than Barry's house Ravane is breaking into in the meantime. The person they are looking for isn't home and the only thing out of order is a messy bookshelf that's visible from the window. Books have been moved and are scattered on the floor.

They also search the nearby church to no avail. Defeated, they decide to head to the docks.

#### Asska and Morai meet with Kathy Swindial
After exchanging some words with [[Skesk Aka-Skal]], [[Asska]] and [[Morai]] head out and encounter [[Kathy Swindial]] talking with [[Elazri Voxkami]]. They find out the [[Codexica Dominion]] is trying to assassinate Elazri for some reason, and that an auction is going to take place in town.

This auction, organized by [[Saw]] on behalf of [[The Doctor]], serves to sell [[Uncertainty Weapon|Uncertainty Weapons]] procured by Kathy. They managed to get a few contacts to talk to.

#### John looks for the other election candidate
After asking around in the crowd, [[John Cowboy|John]] and [[Qal Evans]] head to [[Felixion's Step]] and project an illusion in the sky to contact [[Portman Teeterson]]. He's the political opponent of Jenkins, and the Party has decided to help him win the election if possible.

On the way out, he gets confronted by angry guards. The situation is defused by [[Terissa Monick]] who enchants the guards and shoos them away. Portman is accompanying her. Together, they head to the [[Fatus University]] and Terissa explains she's the Head of Bridges of [[Orion]]. Both of them are Orion members, and are planning to take the city's control from Jenkins and leave it in the [[Knights of the Round Table|Knights]]' hands.

#### Meeting at the docks
The party reconvenes at the Dock of Airs (the northern one). After catching each other up to speed on what happened in the morning, they open the box Ravane found to discover a severed tiefling hand (likely his assistant's hand) and several documents detailing fake shipments and humanitarian aid to [[Erymnos]].

With the guards and soldiers patrolling near Jenkins's house, the group decides to head to [[Gremory's Steps]]. Qal and Ashley return to Glib Stop in the meantime.

#### Gremory's Library
After entering the building, the party is soon approached by [[Deus Gremory|Grey]]. The woman asks Mylàrin if as a follower of Gremory he wants to access her personal library. The group then gets transported to [[Gremory's Library]], a massive library on multiple levels.

They encounter [[Deus Felixion]] and [[Saturn]], who talk with John and Morai respectively. Felixion reveals himself as not an actual god but just a really powerful individual that got a cult of followers. Saturn is instead a powerful member of [[Aurelia's Faith]] and is one of the few who has been allowed to worship both Gremory and [[Deus Aurelia]]. 

[[Mylàrin Ulamoor|Mylàrin]] investigates several books on the first level of the library and finds out gods eliminate all people who, through independent action, accumulate too much [[Sin]]. He also discovers that [[Authority]] is a way for gods to vouch for a mortal so he can accumulate Sin without fear of repercussions. More information on Authority and Sin is on the second level, but the Library requires visitors to have more and more Sin as they go down or they get lost in it forever. The fastest way to acquire the necessary Sin is through receiving Authority.

Gremory once again offers the party to give them Authority, but only on the condition that they all get it at the same time and from the same god. A heated discussion follows where Mylàrin wishes to immediately acquire Authority and deepen his knowledge and get a better read of what they have to do going forward, while Morai wants to wait and carefully evaluate their options. 

The discussion becomes more heated. Mylàrin doesn't want to go forward without knowing more and is afraid to wait and run out of time to save his family, while Morai already had her trust in gods damaged and has rushed things more than she should have. Mylàrin heads to the sairs to the second level alone, determined to proceed without the group. John however manages to convince him to calm down and wait, much to the relief of the others.

The session ends with the group in the library, their current objective to focus on resolving the matter of Asska's tribe, finding out more about the divine deal they are getting themselves into and the auction that is about to take place.
