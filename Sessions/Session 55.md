### Synopsis
**Hekamonia the 1st (cont)**
[[Equinox (The Party)|The Party]] is still investigating on [[Barry Jenkins]]'s crimes.

[[Ravane Soga'tae|Ravane]], [[Mylàrin Ulamoor|Mylàrin]] and [[Morai]] go to [[Marx Gallone]]'s house to investigate his death. They find that he has been replaced and there's a setup to make it look like he's still alive. They also find that the house is some sort of living entity that started attacking them after they discovered it.

After fleeing the house, they use the distraction to enter [[Barry Jenkins]]'s house in the hope to find more information. They get discovered and end up killing him and one of his helpers. They take the body and run.

**Hekamonia the 2nd**
The party goes out to buy things. After that, Morai and [[John Cowboy|John]] have their scheduled meeting with [[Khafra Gild-Ra]] at the bathhouse. [[Twitch]] was there. They find he's dying in 24-48 hours. He insists on having the party help him recover the genocidal wizard. They also learn that [[Sebastian Flowers]] is the leader of [[Orion]] agents.

In the meantime, Mylàrin and Ravane ride south, far away from Moros and try to camp out in the night. There's a magical influence pushing them back towards the town.

In the night, everyone is killed by [[White]]. They wake up moments after, traveling back in time to the morning of the 2nd.
